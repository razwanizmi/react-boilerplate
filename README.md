# React Heroku

A boilerplate to easily deploy React apps to Heroku

## tl;dr

1. Set up with `$ npm install`.
2. Start dev-server with `$ npm run dev`.
3. Postinstall and server script already included in package.json. This will create a production build and start an Express JS server whenever it is pushed to Heroku.
